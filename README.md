## 1. Deep Learning Course study

This repository was the records when studying deep learning courses, firstly I start DL courses from cs244n and cs231n.

## 2. cs244n
CS244N is meanly talk about how to do NLP tasks with DL,  cover word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models,
 recursive neural networks,convolutional neural networks as well as some recent models involving a memory component.Detail introduction at [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
 
 # 3. cs231n
 This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification.
 detail introduction at [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
 
 # 4. Goal
 - complete all the assignments for every lectures
 - write down my own understanding about every models and algorithms, later I will add my blog site
